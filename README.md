# ShapeSense - Shape Completion by Curve Stitching

The ShapeCompletion project aims at recovering (completing) the **structure** of a shape after a portion of it is erased. In other words, given a shape with arbitrarily "discontinued parts", assuming that we have **no prior knowledge** about the shape, how can we **reasonably connect the endpoints** at the discontinuities?
